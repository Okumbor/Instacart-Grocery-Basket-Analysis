# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analytical work for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. The goal of this project is to uncover insights into sales patterns and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation and targeted marketing. The analysis focuses on identifying busy times, spending behaviors, and product popularity to enhance marketing and sales efforts.

## Introduction

Instacart aims to refine its marketing strategies by understanding the diverse customer base and their purchasing behaviors. This project uses various data sets provided by Instacart to analyze customer interactions with the service and develop targeted approaches for different customer segments.

## Objectives

- **Identify Busy Periods**: Determine the busiest days of the week and times of the day to optimize ad scheduling.
- **Analyze Spending Patterns**: Understand when customers are likely to spend more and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Price Range Groupings**: Simplify product prices into range groups to aid in marketing efforts.
- **Product Popularity**: Discover which departments have the highest frequency of orders to guide inventory and promotional strategies.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze differences in customer behaviors based on loyalty, region, demographic factors, and more to tailor marketing approaches.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy.
- **Excel**: Used for additional data processing, particularly for tasks involving time-series analysis and forecasting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Served as the primary interface for conducting data analysis and documenting the process.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: This directory includes the data sets used in the analyses. Given the memory space constraints on GitHub and the size of the data files, this folder is managed to optimize the repository's performance and responsiveness.
- `/scripts`: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks detailing the analysis.
- `/visualizations`: Stores graphical outputs from the analyses that provide insights into customer behaviors and sales trends.
- `/reports`: Includes summary reports and presentations that outline key findings and recommendations for Instacart's stakeholders.

## Data Management and Protection

- **Data Folder Inclusion**: Due to the large size of the datasets and the limited storage capabilities on GitHub, the `/data` directory has been included to manage these files efficiently, ensuring quick access and minimal load times.
- **PII and Data Protection**: All analyses adhere to strict data protection guidelines to ensure the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (PII). Measures are in place to anonymize and secure customer data, adhering to legal and ethical standards.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone https://github.com/Okumbor/Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis.git` to get a local copy of this repository.
- **Data Analysis**: Navigate to the `/scripts` directory to view and run the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.

## Data Visualization

Throughout the project, various data visualizations were created to better understand customer behaviors and enhance decision-making. Below is an example visualization that compares spending behavior profiles by department, illustrating the differences between high and low spenders across various departments:
